    <div class="jumbo">I have experience across industries and believe in service to my community, developing my super-regional branch of the <span class="red">Red</span> Cross, through professional-grade volunteer work in Upper Austria.</div>

        <h2>My day job is with <a href="https://www.faw.at">FAW GMBH (LLC., a university spin-out customizing the Alfresco ECM system),</a> in Hagenberg, Upper Austria, where I do ECM research and research-based support of our client teams like module development, containerization and upgrades.</h2>
        
        <p>I am always open to discuss positions, including contract ones, that can draw on my ECM experience and interests: I am mostly interested in remote work with some availability for travel (hybrid models) in the US or EU/UK, but require visa support elsewhere.</p>
        
        <h3>At the Linz General Hospital Blood and Tissue Bank (Red Cross) I am concentrating on a software engineering research project in the co-domains ECM and Hyper-Automation, in cooperation with Fachhochschule Oberoesterreich, Campus Hagenberg.</h3> 
        
        <p>I formally worked for Red Cross in Linz throughout the Covid-19 pandemic from 2020-23 and continue to stay involved through this project.</p>
