    <h5 class="meta-title">Hello, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heselt-in-e/" target="_blank">Jack Heseltine</a> and this is <b>HESEL<i>TIME</i></b> <i class="ri-time-line"></i></h5>
    <div class="jumbo">I am a <a href="/rDse">formally trained</a> Software and Cloud Engineer in <s><b><i class="ri-heart-line"></i></b> love</s> <b>a professional working relationship</b> with <b>Enterprise Content Management</b> (ECM).</div> 
    
    <img src="assets/img/j.png" alt="Profile Picture of Jack Heseltine" />

    <div class="jumbo">I have experience across industries and believe in service to my community, developing my super-regional branch of the <span class="red">Red</span> Cross up until very recently (2023) but switching to <b>academia and the (university spin-out) private sector</b> as Covid-19 settled.</div>
    <div class="home-sub-text"> 
        <h2>My day job is with <a href="https://www.faw.at">FAW GMBH (LLC., a university spin-out customizing the Alfresco ECM system),</a> in Hagenberg, Upper Austria, where I do ECM research and research-based support of our client teams like module development, containerization and upgrades.</h2>

        <div class="jumbo">In this ECM context I am working on my <a href="/rDai#jku-thesis-overview"><i class="ri-book-line"></i> Master's thesis</a>, but also consulting for Wolfram Research <img width="100" src="assets/img/Mathematica_Logo.png" alt="Mathematica Logo Wolfram Resarch" /> on the side.</div>
        
        <p>I am always open to discuss positions, including contract ones, that can draw on my ECM experience and interests: I am mostly interested in remote work with some availability for travel (hybrid models) in the US or EU/UK, but require visa support elsewhere.</p>
                
        <p>Academically I am interested in AI and how Software can operate across this paradigm and the symbolic one (Symbolic Computation interest, as Masters Student in AI in a symbolic and mathematical track).</p>
