In actual dialog with FAW: here the following idea (from Daniel), let's do a practicum (also covering the FH requirement) with an output that I can submit as practical work at JKU as well. This ties in with the Prof. K. conversation: ECM component (I still think Alfresco makes sense) that interfaces in some way with LLM and possibly offers interface or tool. This can then be the basis for the masters thesis topic outlined by Prof. K2, i.e. a comparison of Few Shot and Finetuning.

Technical note: Daniel interested in the Hyland - Llama open source stuff, wait for info.

Now the really pretty thing about this FAW practicum arrangement (starting with April BTW, current contract runs until end of March): Wolfram Research is an unconditional go! Just start it in January.

And: if the Masters Thesis itself cannot be developed from and at FAW organically, pick up on the offer (!) from Institute of Integrated Study, get paid for all the work.

LinkedIn timeline: RC -> (AE -> ventopay ->) FAW(practical work!) -> Wolfram(consulting! ECM connection, symbolic, AI) -...-> Institute of Integrated Study(wrote thesis!) -...-> we'll see, possibly academic trajectory, and/or startup!

Financially: 15k goal 2024, do selbsterhalter. between FAW three months (ca 1250, so one Month of this year financially), FAW practical (maybe 3M?), and the thesis contract (8M of value and/or Fixanstellung, that would be the goal).

Could be really good. If lacking somehow, need some kinda side job for the difference to the maximum, that is all. Very manageable workload that ties in with academics is the goal, together with full-on Wolfram.
