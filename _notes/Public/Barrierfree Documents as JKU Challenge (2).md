From the original post:

*I found a synergy at JKU in **Prof. G.** of LIT (Linz Institute of Technology) who is hosting a course with challenges to be worked on by students. My idea is to extend my Seminar on Few Shot Learning, Practical Work on potentially an ECM component but certainly some module that connects to an API and works on PDFs to make them barrier-free (accessible), and a resulting Thesis drawing conclusions and comparing in context learning with finetuning by work happening in the applications, organization, legal aspects dimensions, potentially taking this further towards a real (marketable?) application.*

See the current [project proposal](https://github.com/heseltime/heseltime.github.io/blob/e10cc293c4ef0854b5a62fb7f8643861ba82155b/assets/pdf/JKU_CommunityCall_Antrag_Final_Rework.pdf) (DE) as the response.

**Update! This [was successful and is going forward]([Challenges | LIT Open Innovation Center (jku.at)](https://www.jku.at/lit-open-innovation-center/open-innovation-in-science/community-call/challenges/)), see "Accessibility Buddies" project.**

*Quick Housekeeping note: Working on submission of the entry, will need agreement for Institute of Integrated Study. Quick Info note Feb 8th, 2024 to Prof. M. End of Feb Update: All done.*
