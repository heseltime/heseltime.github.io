Preliminary discussion with new Blood Center IT leadership have led to this new focus.

Core questions:

- Is this a workflow project? (If yes, the user meeting that IT leadership will organize internally will specify the user needs.)
- If yes, also, the question remains as to the actual technology this should be implemented in.

This leads us to camunda and a process orchestration-centric view (separating out ECM).

As this develops in this direction (next stop: half page summary and meeting with Fachhochschule) I need develop the technological base options by talking to Camunda and evaluating a workflow-first strategy (with unseen user requirements).

The view is ECM as target of this workflow context, not base.
