# RC Side

- basic ok
- advanced ok to SAAS-approach (where infrastructure is possible via Kubernetes, but does not make sense with the given ressources)
- IT-internal project with URS and on that basis, a last ok to FH-project

# Camunda side

- (Camunda for Common Good/Camunda im Dienste des Gemweinwohls)[https://camunda.com/common-good/] contract

# FH-side

- project-framework (another ok, but equivalent to RC's last ok) to get a project-focused initiative (with initial installation/coordination with Camunda) off the ground
