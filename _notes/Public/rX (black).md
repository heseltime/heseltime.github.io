rX-pivot in the sense that it looks like the red has to be taken out of it! I wanted to do this as a Red Cross project but it turns out my superiors saw it as an investment in me as their employee, not their company and code base, which is how I see this. This was apparent in the project's cancellation at Blood Bank Linz when I announced my departure as their employee (the project was to happen in studies alone) -- in their view and decision, no employee, no project.

I can see their logic: this project will be spun up and out in some other context, I am sure, in any case my studies requires a project, so that will happen.

I want to note to myself my learning about software in non profit organizations lime the one I had the privilege to work for for some years out of college.

- Adjectives to describe the place: conservative, less techy, risk-averse, lack of incentives for quick moves. This goes to explain the rationale in my situation.
- I think the sum is an environment that really does not allow for novel and larger scale software projects, save special coalitions between individual actors.
- Non profits will have to buy these types of solutions as products instead.

The inefficiency here is the only part I lament: the Red Cross, and I have witnessed this, will not realize its information potential if implementation does not come close. Low and no code is here but is limited. The companies that the non profit buys from cannot and will not understand the use case and real need the way the org does, and the org will not be able to communicate it, because stakeholders are scattered and IT limited.

I continue to believe in a dedicates in house team but it seems to take exceptional circumstances to get there. Even in new generation leadership the line is risk averse and anti-innovation to that degree, that is, the "Red Cross will never write software."*

I said I will apply the day they decide to hire a software engineer. **

*The IT department does of course write software, but not in the engineering sense of testing, professional tools, full solutions, etc

** Vienna is hiring software engineers: it remains to be tested if these are "real" software engineering positions.
