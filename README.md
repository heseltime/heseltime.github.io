# Based on Jekyll Garden v 0.4!
From the base project: "Jekyll Garden theme lets you publish your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault (or a subset of it) as a Jekyll static website. The theme is markdown and Obsidian setup friendly. You can use your own server or Github page to set up your SSG."

## Further Development (WDP3)

### Cross-Page Nav Bar (CSS and Vanilla JavaScript)

Goal: In terms of content, draw together different directions of my studies. Technically, attempt an implementation to add on to the Jekyll Garden (JG) framework base.

Method: 

### Favicons

Goal: Cross-functional favicons.

Method: Using WDP-source [Favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) and [How to Favicon in 2021](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-favicon-in-2021/), which is recent enough.
