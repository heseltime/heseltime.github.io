Thank you for taking care of Shabu for a short while! She is great, here are some notes about what she likes and needs, since she cannot speak. Which you know, of course.

# Cats #

She is fine with cats, in fact lives with three of them at home. One thing though: you should keep the cat or cats out of sight when Shabu gets her food, ideally keeping them seperate in another room. She tends to snap at them because she feels anxious about them grabbing her food. Other than this easily managed form of food guarding I have never observed any animal (or human) directed agression in Shabu, and it is not aimed at people by the way, so never feel scared to touch her bowl yourself. But be careful about the cats.

And to be fair, the cats at home do sometimes eat her food when she is not looking.

Speaking of food!

# Food # 

Shabu usually gets fed twice a day, with a mix of wet and dry food, half and half, mornings and evenings, though sometimes she doesn't want to eat. In such cases I just take her bowl after a while and put it in the fridge for her next meal time. Water to drink should be available all day.
