Thank you for taking care of Shabu for a short while! She is great, here are some note about what she likes and needs, since she cannot speak. Which you know, of course.

# Cats #

She is fine with cats, in fact lives with three of them at home. One thing though: you should keep the cat or cats out of sight when Shabu get's her food: she can snap at them because she feels anxious about the cat grabbing her food. 

Speaking of food!

# Food # 

Shabu usually gets fed twice a day, with a mix of wet and dry food, half and half, mornings and evenings, though sometime she doesn't want to eat. In such cases I just take her bowl after a while and put it in the fridge for her next meal time. Water to drink should be available all day.
