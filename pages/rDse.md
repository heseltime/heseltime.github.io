@University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - Hagenberg Campus, Hagenberg: I am following a rigorous Software Engineering curriculum for a second Bachelor's degree in the subject, focussing mostly on the technical underpinnings and languages, but also related topics and soft skills, from project management through to modeling languages and approaches.

What follows is documentation of my research project and thesis in Document Processing along with <b>a list of courses matching my transcript from school</b> below.

# Thesis with RISC (Research Institute Symbolic Computation) also @Hagenberg: Mathematical Document Processing #

Not just Document Processing (often: Document Preparation), but <b>Mathematical</b> Document Processing: the goal a translation tool from Mathematica to LaTeX in the context of RISC's Theorema Tool. Work in Progress, more [Details directly from RISC](https://risc.jku.at/th/theorema-project-document-processing/). 

RISC is an international institute with a research focus on various branches of symbolic computation.

# Software Engineering Full Curriculum (Bachelor's of Science '24) #

Fifth semester starts in fall 2023, sixth semester is all about practice and in the field; limited course work in that time - spring 2024.

- Lecture: IT Law (Austria/EU focus, but the concepts travel)
- Study Project in C# with Industry Partner in Hagenberg ([ventopay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ventopay-gmbh))
- Thesis (see above)

## fourth semester

## second semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Math 1 - Linear Algebra
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Algorithms and Datastructures (more PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Object Oriented Programming (more PASCAL, all of first year was PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Operating Systems
- Lecture + Exercise: Computer Networking
- Lecture + Exercise: Databases and Data Modeling
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Software Project Engineering
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Mircoeconomics/Accounting


## first semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Logic and Math 0
- Lecture + Exercise: Elementary Algorithms and Datastructures (PASCAL as language of instruction!*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Basic Concepts of Programming (more PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Fundamentals of Computer Science and Computer Architecture
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Project Engineering
- Lecture + Exercise: Microeconomics
- Exercise/Regular Workshop: Holding Technical Presentations
- Exercise: Operating Systems and Linux Basics

*PASCAL as language of instruction: the idea is to teach a language most people have not touched yet and develop the concepts in that language. The language's inventor, Niklaus Wirth, actually designed the langauge for teaching purposes. I think the approach makes sense. From PASCAL I studied C, then C++, Java, C#, JavaScript and Scripting Languges like PHP and Swift, very methodologically.
