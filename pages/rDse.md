@University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - Hagenberg Campus, Hagenberg: I am following a rigorous Software Engineering curriculum for a second Bachelor's degree in the subject, focussing mostly on the technical underpinnings and languages, but also related topics and soft skills, from project management through to modeling languages and approaches.

**What follows is documentation of my research project and thesis in Document Processing along with a list of courses matching my transcript from school below.** **Update**: In-progress presentation at [Wolfram Summer Program 2024](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/heseltine/Published/mentor-talk-wolfram-summer-program-2024.nb) ([Repo](https://github.com/heseltime/wsrp2024-mentor-talk)), with a special emphasis on using WL for Software Engineering and thinking of Mathematica notebooks as documents, informed by my ECM (Enterprise Content Management) background.

# Thesis with RISC (Research Institute Symbolic Computation) also @Hagenberg: Mathematical Document Processing #

Not just Document Processing (often: Document Preparation), but <b>Mathematical</b> Document Processing: the goal a translation tool from Mathematica to LaTeX in the context of RISC's Theorema Tool. [Details directly from RISC](https://risc.jku.at/th/theorema-project-document-processing/) (RISC is an international institute with a research focus on various branches of symbolic computation) and [here an initial presentation given about the project (some DE, but the main content is in EN)](..\assets\pdf\Tma2TexPresentation1.pdf) scheduled for completion by June/July 2024.

# Software Engineering Full Curriculum (Bachelor's of Science '24) #

## sixth semester

_This semester also credits for practical, internship-type work, which I am completing with Wolfram Research, [as part of my consulting work with the company.](/wolfram) Will include a short write-up as well: I will link it when I have it, maybe with production code samples and analysis if I can get permissions, on the topic of using WL for Software Engineering._

- Lecture + Exercise: Software Development with Enterprise Technologies: Java-Stack focus initially, covering Modules (JPMS) and Build Systems (Maven and Gradle), ORM (JPA and Hibernate), [Spring (Boot)](/portfolio#open-api), but also Entity Framework - see .NET last semester.
- Combined Lecture & Exercise: Current Trends in Web Technologies (Blockchain, NFTs, ... all the good stuff)
- Study Project in C# with Industry Partner in Hagenberg ([ventopay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ventopay-gmbh)) - Part II
- Lecture + Exercise: Distributed and Parallel Systems - favorite exercise project: [Toilet simulation](https://github.com/heseltime/VPSToilet) for parallelizing (synchronizing) toilet goers (producers) with their local facilities (consumers).
- Lecture: Information Management: a nice full circle back to where getting serious about software (in my particular AI/ML context) started - the _IT department_ (in my case, of a Red Cross blood bank at the height of the global onset of Covid-19). In the end all development has to fit into a cohesive IT (IM) structure, otherwise it is 100% pointless. Though, I will say, my way in was always _**processes**_, and not hardware outfitting and helpdesk management, essential as these are for overall IM, say, in the ITIL framework.

## fifth semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Component-Oriented Software Engineering (C# and .NET)

    - _to add a personal note, **this** was the most challenging course (for me) in the whole studies: getting really specific about OO programming as implemented by Microsoft and with all the .NET framework as it makes provisions for async programming, databases and web platforms, was the task. I motivated myself to study this stuff by connecting to my Work in WL, in fact literally: you can, it turns out, [call the WL kernel **fairly easily** from a .NET program](https://github.com/heseltime/SWK5-W-WolframNETLink), allowing for a radical extension of programming capabilities into the Mathematica domain - it's pretty cool._

- Lecture + Exercise: Web-Architectures and Frameworks (Angular focus)
- Lecture + Exercise: Virtualization Tooling (Docker focus)
- Lecture + Exercise: ~~Mobile Computing~~ Advanced Python, [credited from work over at JKU](/rDai#housekeeping) - sometimes you have to focus, in my case [AI-oriented work](/rDai) at this time. I played around with Swift as part of [my Bachelor-level prep, in AI _and CS_](/rDai#housekeeping), for my AI-Masters at JKU, as far as mobile goes - this course would have been in Kotlin. It's the one course from the full curriculum I did not do.
- Lecture: IT Law (Austria/EU focus, but the concepts travel)
- Study Project in C# with Industry Partner in Hagenberg ([ventopay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ventopay-gmbh)) - Part I
- Thesis (see above) + Thesis Seminar

## fourth semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Graph Theory/Intermediate Python
- Lecture + Exercise: Modern Platforms Programming (C++ and Java/C#)
- Lecture + Exercise: Database-Systems and Semi-Strutured Data
- Lecture + Exercise: Computer Graphics and Image Processing
- Lecture + Exercise: Thesis Research Prep Course
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Development Methodologies - Usability Engineering
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Development Methodologies - Testing and Test-Automization
- Lecture + Exercise: Business Process Management
- Lecture + Exercise: Scripting Languages/PHP-Web-Project

## third semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Math 2 - Statistics
- Lecture + Exercise: Classic Programming Languages (C and C++)
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Computer Networking
- Lecture + Exercise: Database-Systems
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Development Methodologies - Modern Tools and Processes
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Development Methodologies - UML-Modeling
- Lecture + Exercise: Web Development/Web-Project

## second semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Math 1 - Linear Algebra
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Algorithms and Datastructures (more PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Object Oriented Programming (more PASCAL, all of first year was PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Operating Systems
- Lecture + Exercise: Computer Networking
- Lecture + Exercise: Databases and Data Modeling
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Software Project Engineering
- Lecture + Exercise: Advanced Mircoeconomics/Accounting


## first semester

- Lecture + Exercise: Logic and Math 0
- Lecture + Exercise: Elementary Algorithms and Datastructures (PASCAL as language of instruction!*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Basic Concepts of Programming (more PASCAL*)
- Lecture + Exercise: Fundamentals of Computer Science and Computer Architecture
- Lecture + Exercise: Software Project Engineering
- Lecture + Exercise: Microeconomics
- Exercise/Regular Workshop: Holding Technical Presentations
- Exercise: Operating Systems and Linux Basics

*PASCAL as language of instruction: the idea is to teach a language most people have not touched yet and develop the concepts in that language. The language's inventor, Niklaus Wirth, actually designed the langauge for teaching purposes. I think the approach makes sense. From PASCAL I studied C, then C++, Java, C#, JavaScript and Scripting Languges like PHP and Swift, very methodologically.

[Translated from the German](https://www.fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg/studiengaenge/bachelor/software-engineering/alle-infos-zum-studium/studienplan-vollzeit/) and with my own notes.

## ++ another note

When it comes to development work, what I notice time and time again, is that there is some much IT/admin involved to get to a place where you can effectively "develop" (also the soft wrappers involved in getting the specs, if those are not a given), that I would really consider any and all work in that domain as much of an asset as any of the formal skills learned according to the list above. 

This is where Software Engineering is as much an art and a coordination (and so on) soft skill as an engineering discipline.
