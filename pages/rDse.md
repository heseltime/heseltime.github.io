title: Research in Compiler-Compilers (w/ some Model Checking)
feedformat: none

## Here I show what I work on at FH Upper Austria (Hagenberg) with input from Johannes Kepler University classes. ##

**_Or, in terms of content, I really love those almost linguistic inroads to thinking about and working with programs, where model checking and compiler-compiling actually feel like two sides to the same coin. The question is how to make the program alwas do the right things, in both these areas: The compiler-compiler being the generating tool, the model implementation of a given program being the test case._**

# Let's focus on compiler-compilers here. #
