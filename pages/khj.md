# Thematic Talks for KHJ: Wine & Cheese Format Initiative/Open Call for Input Talks by KHG People

## Introduction

My office of chairman to the board for KHJ is very much in service of KHG, where, absent a strong/vocal Catholic identitity group even in Upper Austria nowadays, or, at least at the university. It is a place I have come to appreciate, and yes, love! One thing I see missing however is an old tradition, of hosting and holding talks and workshops under the banner of "thematic" ("thematisch" in German) @KHG. 

I want to initate the appropriate resuciatation! Join me in this first aid effort.

## The Idea

Wine and Cheese are intended to help restore the core intellectual tradition of topical evenings held at KHG pre-Covid but that somehow got lost for a little while.

With a quiet foundation in Christian values, my approach has a pragmatics of trying to give people tools for self-help and change. So for example, the very first KHJ Wine and Cheese Prototype had a techy Web Apps topic, because that is how I myself happen to earn money and make my studies happen at Masters level, as far as the studies allow for work.

So it was very much about bringing the right people together as well as establishing the format, where I hope to call on other speakers in the future.

## Talks Happening Currently

**JKU of course has technical focus** to a degree, _Masters degree or PhD even_, but still, the thought is to expand horizons beyond technical fields and get into a rhythm: now techy, next time philosophical; a talk by someone in KHG, then a talk by someone from outside. A workshop-, then a discussion-focus. And so on. So, here is my ...
