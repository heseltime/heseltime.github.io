Thank you for stopping by! 

Looking for a safe and clean room/bed/base with direct access to Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz, Austria, for work and/or school and the short term? **You have come to the right place.**

# Coming Soon #

Situated at Katholische Hochschulgemeinde (KHG), the Catholic Academic Society, at JKU, in the top floor, the small apartment is occupied during most weeks but is often free on the weekends and as such, is offered for booking as a short-term sublet in accordance with KHG policy. At a minimum the convetible couch-bed depicted below is available in the living room (at a discount), or in the case that the whole apartment is free, you have you own (double) bed and bed room, in addition to said living room, also with kitchen and separated working area, and a bathroom and small balcony.
