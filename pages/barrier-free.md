The following is a synthesis of the final logical steps in concluding my Master's thesis, on the ECM (Enterprise Content Management) topic of "Suitability of Large Language Models for Making PDF-Documents More Accessible and Barrier-free (in Enterprise Content Management)" - the thesis itself has a broader view, here the focus is on the LLM/ML-tooling used in evaluation of LLM output on the task itself, with a view to advancing in this area as LLMs become more powerful and capable, and/or fine-tuned LLMs including tuning on this task or adjacent ones are produced (or in combination, powerful, fine-tuned LLMs).
